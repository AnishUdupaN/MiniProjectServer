move logout button to somewhere in the top right
in the downside bottom page of faiourites, logout,etc, there should be only 2:
    regular documents
    view once documents

when on mainactivity.kt, send an get request to the server:



first, implement the location feature on security check page
then, send an get request /listfiles to the server requesting for documents
list all the "normal" files in the regular documents page
list all the onetime files in the view once page


for every 5 seconds, send an get message on / to get the json:
    {
    "message": "Server OK."
    }
    if we get any error,then display the error in red in the screen.
    If the error is because it could not connect to the server, then display an popup saying it could not connect to server and display an button "Exit", which exits the app

clicking on an filename should open it inside the app.
as soon as the user exits the document view, send again an /listfiles to ensure that files deleted for user will not be displayed again
